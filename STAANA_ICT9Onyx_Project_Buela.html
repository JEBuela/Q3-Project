        Fire accidents can occur at any place and that includes our home, other modern locations, and natural environments. 

		    We don't only want human lives to be saved from fire incidents, but also our nature. A major example that we can provide are wild forest fires. Forest fires have a huge effect on the earth's climate. This includes wildfires, global warming, deforestation, and the deaths of wild animals.</p>
		    <p>
		    I'm afraid to say that some common causes of forest fires are caused by human carelessness. In here are provided some ways to help as a living being on Earth.</p>

			<td>Oh we love to enjoy forest camping with friends and family don't we? Well, we're not saying people should stop forest camping, what we're trying to inform you is that there should be a proper use of making a campfire. Some humans leave the campfire unattended, this can be affected by storms or whatsoever, or campfires can spark and spread in the grass and touch trees and spread around the forest.

      So, after singing along with your companions in a campfire and you feel like it's past your bedtime, why not shut off your little campfire before sleeping?</td>

			<td>Oh, smoking. Well, there are people who smoke in the forest such as illegal loggers and people who hang around the wild forest, we can never tell. This is also an example of human carelessness, and incorrect disposal of cigarettes can cause forest fires. 

      A little advice here, if you're a cigarette user, never smoke in the forest. It's bad for the trees and it's also bad for you.</td>

			<td>Whether you're grilling hotdogs or whatsoever that involves heat (that includes electronics that are open to fire), please keep them away from the trees, grass, etc. Make sure to place them in a safe place where it can't cause a fire incident.

			These can also heavily cause wildfires, and we should be mindful of using these flammable items.</td>
